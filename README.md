# Internship-IBIVU

This repository is a collection of the scripts that I made during my internship at IBIVU. It is purely meant as an archive, many of these scripts have hardcoded variables or need a specific working directory. For me personally this repo serves as 1) an archive in case I need anything later, and 2) a way to record my current coding skills which I can compare myself to later.
Having said that, feel free to look around and use any scripts or code snippets to your liking!
